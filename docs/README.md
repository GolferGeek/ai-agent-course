# ai-agent-course

## Welcome!  
I'm writing this course as an introduction to AI Agents, Cursor AI, Nextjs, and AI Coding.  All awesome topics on their own; but super-fun when put together.

## This Is for You, if
You are a traditional coder with no experience in all this newness.  Others can grab what they want.  But I'm writing this for my super-smart nephew with a C.S. degree and his dad (my best friend since high school) who had his first P.C. before I did.

## Basic structure
First, you should immediately do a git branch '000-Start-Branch'.

You should notic a license, this README.md, and a folder 'docs'.  Pull up docs/000/instructions.md.  This is a markdown file (you can think of it as super-simple HTML).  You can press the view preview up above to see it without all of the markdown symbols and it looks more presentable.  I'm just used to seeing it like this.  :)

Follow the instructions.  When you are done and everything works you can head to the next branch "002-LangChain-OpenAI-Chat".
